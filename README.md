# Schedule
Each Tuesday  from 10 till 12 in the room HG047 (from 8th of April till 11th of July). 

Exceptions: 6th of May.


# Notes
Notes from each session are found in folder [/doc](/doc)


# Syllabus

The plan is to introduce into general concepts of programming, but also look at some of the details and have some hands-on practice.

Ideally first a participant presents a particular concept in one or two computer languages and then participants can react and present the syntax in another language.

After some discussion and experience exchange we should always have a little practice session, where this concept can be tried out.

As standard languages to compare with I suggest to include on a case-to-case basis the following:

Matlab, R, C, C++, Julia, Java, Rust, Python
