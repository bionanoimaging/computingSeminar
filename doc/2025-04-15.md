If you want to have interactive [matplotlib graphs](https://matplotlib.org/) type in conda environment
``` 
python -m pip install ipympl
```
and then in the jupyter notebook type this magic command
```
%matplotlib ipympl
```

- jupyter in vscode

Install adds-on __Jupyter__ in vscode. You can now create jupyter cells by command ``` #%% _nameOfTheCell ``` in python script. You can then run the cell in the interactive mode with shortcut ``` Shift-Enter ```
